# Introduction to Computational Social Sciences

This is a GitGHub repository of the Inter-Semester course *Introduction to Computational Social Sciences* held at SciencesPo Paris in January 2025. This class has three main goals. First, we want to help students understand how to address data limitations by automatically collecting textual data and choosing the right corpora for their research interests. Second, we aim to expose students to various practical methods for analyzing text quantitatively, enabling them to conduct their own research and potentially prepare for more extensive projects like a Master's thesis. Lastly, we hope that students will improve their programming skills and grasp quantitative reasoning, which can be applied to handle different types of data, not just text.


# Program

## Day 5
Large Language Models

# Course Structure
The course will take place over a span of five days and integrates lectures with hands-on lab-sessions to apply the methods. Each morning session, lasting for two hours, is dedicated to presenting comprehensive content on the methods employed. This includes an exploration of the underlying logic, advantages, disadvantages, and typical applications of the methods discussed. In the afternoon, the first session will focus on demonstrating the practical application of these methods. The final session of each day is designed to actively engage students in applying the knowledge they have acquired throughout the day. 

# Prerequisites
The course requires basic knowledge of RStudio. In terms of coding skills, this course picks up where the RStudio lab sessions for the Quantitative Methods II of the School of Research lecture ended. The final day introduces students to a text analysis application in Python, but no knowledge of this language is required.
