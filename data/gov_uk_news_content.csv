Press release,Eight-year ban for former footballer who ran London sports academy,"Kieron Minto-St.Aimie received a director’s disqualification for claiming a £25,000 Covid loan his company was not entitled to.",2024-12-23,The Insolvency Service,"Kieron Minto-St.Aimie is a former professional footballer who went on to run a sports academy in Brent. 
His company received the £25,000 Covid Bounce Back Loan after he overstated its turnover. 
He was disqualified as a company director for eight years at London’s Royal Courts of Justice. 

A former professional footballer has been banned from being a company director for eight years. 

Kieron Minto-St.Aimie claimed a £25,000 Covid Bounce Back Loan for the St Aimie’s Sports Academy Community Interest Company in Brent, when it was entitled to much less. 

Elizabeth Pigney, Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service, said: “Kieron Minto-St.Aimie successfully applied for a Covid Bounce Back loan by overstating his company’s turnover. 

His eight-year disqualification should serve as a warning to others that the justice system will not allow business owners to make false declarations to obtain funds that were so crucially needed by other small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic.

The former footballer, aged 35, of Pound Lane in London, began his career at Queens Park Rangers before spells at clubs including Oxford United and Barnet. 

He opened St.Aimie’s Sports Academy, on Harlesden Road in Brent, as its sole director in 2016. 

Before its closure in January 2023, the academy was known in the local community for providing football coaching and mentoring to children and young people. 

In May 2020, Minto-St.Aimie applied for a Covid Bounce Back loan of £25,000. 

However, in order to obtain the £25,000 he overstated the company’s turnover by £60,000 as it should have only been entitled to around £10,000 under the scheme based on its actual turnover. 

On 6 December 2024, the judge at London’s Royal Courts of Justice disqualified Minto-St.Aimie as a company director for eight years.

Kieron Minto-St.Aimie is of Pound Lane, London. His date of birth is 4 May, 1989.

Press release,British soldiers successfully test drone killer radiowave weapon for first time,British soldiers have successful trialled for the first time a game-changing weapon that can take down a swarm of drones using radio waves for less than the cost of a pack of mince pies.,2024-12-23,Ministry of Defence,"Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapons (RFDEW) can take down a swarm of drones for less than the cost of a pack of mince pies. 

Systems are capable of hitting targets up to 1km away and costs just 10p per shot 

The programme supports more than 135 highly-skilled jobs across UK industry 

British soldiers have successfully trialled for the first time a game-changing weapon that can take down a swarm of drones using radio waves for less than the cost of a pack of mince pies. 

The Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon (RFDEW) development system can detect, track and engage a range of threats across land, air and sea. 

RFDEWs are capable of neutralising targets up to 1km away with near instant effect and at an estimated cost of 10p per shot fired, providing a cost-effective complement to traditional missile-base air defence systems. 

The RFDEW is different from Laser Directed Energy Weapons – such as DragonFire - because it uses a radio frequency to disrupt hostile threats, rather than a laser beam of light energy. 

The weapon uses high frequency waves to disrupt or damage critical electronic components inside devices such as drones, causing them to be immobilised or fall out of the sky. It can also be used against threats on land and at sea. 

The British Army successfully trialed a demonstrator version of the RFDEW. The development system has been produced by a consortium led by Thales UK and including sub-contractors QinetiQ, Teledyne e2v and Horiba Mira and supports up to 135 high-skilled jobs in the UK. 

This progress helps deliver on the Government’s Plan for Change by rapidly advancing technologies and building on the strong foundation of national security. 

Its high level of automation means the system can be operated by a single person and could be mounted onto a military vehicle, such as a MAN SV, to provide mobility. 

Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry, Maria Eagle MP, said: 

The successful firing by the British soldiers of our Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon is another step forward for a potentially game-changing sovereign weapon for the UK. 

It’s great to see defence experts and industry working collaboratively to put cutting-edge equipment in the hands of our Armed Forces. 

This is demonstration of the UK remaining at the forefront of directed energy weapons and developing a crucial advantage against the emerging threats we face.

A live firing trial was recently completed by the Army’s Royal Artillery Trials and Development Unit and 7 Air Defence Group at a range in West Wales, where they successfully targeted and engaged Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS), in a first for the British Armed Forces. 

The user experimentation trials completed in recent months have enabled Army air defence personnel to explore and exercise the capability’s potential in different configurations across a variety of range environments, threat types and engagement scenarios. 

This activity follows the development process announced back in May and delivered by Team HERSA - a joint enterprise between UK MOD’s Defence Equipment & Support and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). 

Dstl Programme Lead, Matt Cork said: 

Getting this technology into the hands of our service personnel is hugely rewarding. 

Dstl has worked collaboratively with DE&S and industry which has meant the rapid evolution of radio frequency technology. 

Nigel MacVean, Managing Director, Thales IAS, said: 

I am thrilled with the successful RFDEW firing trials. Thales has been at the forefront of this pioneering technology for over 40 years and our continued research and development in this sector, along with our partners in Government, paves the way for a strong future in this field.

This latest trial marks a pivotal moment in the UK’s ongoing efforts to enhance the future operational capabilities of the Armed Forces and offers a precise, powerful, and cost-effective means to defeat multiple aerial threats. 

The trials programme will continue to enable further development and experimentation, while Team HERSA continues to work with operators to develop RFDEW requirements, doctrine and technology, shaping the next generation of mission-optimised RFDEWs. ","Military equipment, logistics and technology"
Press release,Local treasures in Wales to be saved and restored,"Over £2 million will be awarded to seven local treasures in Wales including community centres, music venues and leisure centres.",2024-12-23,"Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","Seven local treasures in Wales including community centres, music venues and leisure centres will be saved and restored thanks to prioritised funding from the UK Government 
UK Government funding will protect local amenities that keep communities thriving, helping fix the foundations of our communities as part of the Plan for Change 
This will help kickstart economic growth and rebuild Britain in a decade of renewal

Over £2 million will be awarded to 7 much-loved local places in Wales, so they can stay open to keep their communities thriving. 

This includes £1 million to save 4 spaces in Wales, including the Tafarn y Plu pub in Gwynedd, The Bunkhouse music venue in Swansea, a museum in Powys and a community shop in Gwynedd. This funding will be used to refurbish, renovate and secure the future of each of these buildings, allowing them to offer a diverse programme of events and activities including live music, well-being sessions and educational opportunities. 

As set out in its Plan for Change, the UK government is committed to kickstarting economic growth and raising living standards. Thriving communities lie at the heart of a thriving economy, and the support provided by the Community Ownership Fund will inject funding where it is most needed, making change happen and bringing people together in the process. 

The highest single award in Wales - £400 thousand - will also go to saving Llanfair Light Railway station and Cloverlands car model museum. This project will host a museum, archives, and a shared community space for residents and visitors to use. The funding will allow the community building to provide a visitor centre in which tours will learn the context to the railway station and its operations. 

Minister for Local Growth, Alex Norris said: 

“These are all multi-functional spaces that do so much for local people and most of us will have fond memories in treasured places like these. 

“We’ve prioritised these grants to help preserve and upgrade what these vital places offer to their communities – whether improving access to sport, tackling loneliness or boosting family services for parents and children.” 

Projects also set to receive money in Wales include: 

£300,000 to renovate Eveswell Community Centre in Newport. The centre will provide new and improved facilities for local families to host more activities like family groups, play groups, a Lego club, craft classes and after school youth groups. 

£300,000 to refurbish the Pentre Comrades club. The transformed building will provide the community a central hub to use for socialising and learning with facilities including a pub, shop, café, community garden, and kitchen spaces. 

£299,000 to renovate and refurbish Caerphilly Rugby Football Club. The space will provide new and improved facilities for their rugby development programmes as well as space to host events like fundraisers, local festivals and educational workshops. 

Welsh Secretary, Jo Stevens said:

“Congratulations to these fantastic community projects in Wales. Over £2 million is being spent by the UK Government to make sure that these special places are refurbished and improved so they can provide facilities for local people to come together. 

“All across Wales there are brilliant people who give back to their communities. I’d like to thank them for all that they do and the UK Government is proud to be able to support them.” 

This UK-wide funding prioritised by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will help protect these cherished places from closure and disrepair, preserving popular spots for local people and visitors. 

Altogether £36 million has been awarded to 85 projects across the UK. 

The projects will support the government on its path to national renewal through its missions in the Plan for Change - from breaking down barriers to opportunity to kickstarting economic growth and creating safer streets by restoring community pride.",Community and society

Cherished community centres are among the 85 local venues across the UK that are set to receive government support to stay open, helping to fix the foundations of our communities.

An additional £36 million of funding has been provided to back local communities, including the rescue of at least 35 community centres, protecting vital local services, boosting opportunities for working families and supporting local economies.

As set out in its Plan for Change, the government is committed to kickstarting economic growth and raising living standards.

The projects will support the government on its path to national renewal, helping realise our regions’ huge potential while creating safer and happier streets by restoring community pride.

Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner said:

“We are delivering on our Plan for Change by saving these vital community assets to provide important opportunities for working people and their families.

“These projects represent what is so special about communities across the UK – bringing people of all ages together, providing vital support and giving them a sense of purpose and belonging.

“Every project will support social causes in the community, keeping widely used services open and thriving to improve people’s health and wellbeing.”

Minister for Local Growth, Alex Norris said:

“These are all multi-functional spaces that do so much for local people and most of us will have fond memories in treasured places like these.

“We’ve prioritised these grants to help preserve and upgrade what these vital places offer to their communities – whether that’s improving access to sport and education, tackling loneliness or boosting family services for parents and children.

“This is just the start of our work to support communities and give them greater control of their assets and we’ll be setting out our full strategy next year.”

Action4Youth, a youth charity in the South East, has been given £300,000 to refurbish the George Amey Centre in Milton Keynes, securing its future as a centre for outdoor education and supporting the charity’s work to tackle knife and gang crime.

Chief Executive of Action4Youth, Jenifer Cameron said:

“We are so grateful to have funding which will enable us to complete our renovation project and to ensure the future of the outdoor centre which benefits 15,000 children and young people each year.

“We can now look forward with optimism and hope to support many more young people in future.”

Nineteen sports clubs and leisure facilities across the country will be saved, including four historic swimming pools. These include the 1960s Portishead Lido in North Somerset - where funding will also be used to renovate the café, supporting the local economy - and one of the last tidal pools left in the country, the Victorian Shoalstone Pool in Devon.

On the Isle of Wight, the Isorropia Foundation will receive more than £1m to purchase and renovate the Medina Valley Centre so it can provide a range of community services including mental health support, training and educational opportunities. And Elmfield Hall in Accrington will be renovated to secure its future as a location for counselling, mentoring and employment courses.

The MacMillan Hub in Edinburgh will be backed with £1.7m so it can continue to promote culture, learning and training opportunities, work and well-being in and around the town centre, and expand its café. And more than £1m will be used to restore the Higher Woodhill Viaduct so the East Lancashire Railway can continue to deliver a heritage railway experience, boosting the local tourism industry in the process.

To tackle loneliness and support rural communities, £3.8 million will go to eight parks and eight pubs, including £300,000 to help buy back a popular village pub in North Yorkshire - The Punch Bowl Inn. £300,000 will also be used to renovate a 200-year-old countryside pub in Gwyned, Wales - Tafarn y Plu. This funding will back local businesses, create jobs and drive growth while restoring community pride.

The government is also developing proposals for delivering on its manifesto commitment to introduce a stronger ‘Right to Buy’ and take over important community assets so they can determine their future in a meaningful way. This will be a genuine shift so local people feel far more control, power and agency in the places they live.

Press release,New protections for British food and drink in Japan,"UK secures special protected status as geographical indications for a further 39 British food and drink products in Japan.  ",2024-12-22,"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs","Diners in Japan will be tucking into authentic UK products this festive period after the country granted special protected status to nearly 40 British food and drink products. 

Festive favourites such as Single Malt Welsh Whisky and Beacon Fell Traditional Lancashire Cheese are just some of the products to receive the status, which means British businesses can export to Japan with confidence that their products are protected against imitation. 

The news has been welcomed as an early Christmas present by food and drink businesses across the UK and could see a boost to British exports in Japan.

Japan’s population of 124 million has a strong appetite for international food and drink and the country’s status as the world’s fourth largest economy in 2023 highlights the strength of its consumer market and the commercial opportunities for premium British products. 

39 distinctive products from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, already protected and celebrated by the UK Government as geographical indications (GIs), have formally gained protection following the completion of Japanese scrutiny processes. 

These protections will safeguard British food and drink products with a distinct local identity, supporting jobs and tourism in mainly rural areas and boosting local growth, as part of the government’s Plan for Change. 

The latest batch of GIs follows 37 that gained protection in the country earlier this year, including Cornish Pasties and Anglesey Sea Salt. 

Minister for Food Security Daniel Zeichner said:

 I’m thrilled to see there’s a taste for authentic British food and drink in Japan. We are committed to growing trade opportunities for British producers around the world as part of our Plan for Change, boosting growth and benefitting businesses across the country. 

The UK is home to a feast of flavours from every corner of the British Isles. With the new agreement between the UK and Japan, consumers will now be able to chew over their choices with confidence, knowing they’re getting the quality and reputation that British food is known for - it’s the perfect recipe for success.

Trade Minister Douglas Alexander said: 

Iconic UK products such as Ayrshire New Potatoes and Carmarthen Ham will now benefit from protected status in Japan. From Sussex to Armagh we are securing protections for unique British food and drink products, ensuring Japanese consumers can rest assured that they are receiving authentic, high-quality British produce.

This early Christmas present to British producers will give them confidence when exporting to Japan, helping them sell more, grow their business and ultimately drive economic growth.” 

Co-founder of Rathfinny Wine Estate, Mark Driver said:

We launched Rathfinny’s Traditional Method Sussex sparkling wines in Japan in 2023 and are delighted that the Sussex PDO will now be afforded protection in Japan. The Sussex PDO is a mark of both provenance and quality, ensuring any wine with ‘Sussex’ on the label has had to pass a stringent blind tasting and high analytical standards.

Rathfinny’s Traditional Method Sussex sparkling wines are produced on a single-site vineyard, in the iconic South Downs near the Seven Sisters in East Sussex. They are now available across Japan through the specialist wine importer, Vin Passion.

Chief Executive Officer of Penderyn Distillery, Stephen Davies said: 

Japan is an important market for world-class single malt whisky, making it a key target market for Penderyn Single Malt Welsh Whisky. 

We have a great partner (Whisk-E) and together we plan to build awareness and reputation for our unique brand from Wales. The establishment of the geographical indication for Single Malt Welsh Whisky in 2022 was an important milestone in the development of the whisky industry in Wales and to have recognition in Japan will be a great achievement to support our export strategy.

Co-Founder and Managing Director of Halen Môn, Alison Lea-Wilson said: 

We are proud to have the name and method of Halen Môn recognised in Japan as authentic and possessing the special qualities that set it apart from other salts. 

GI status offers brands such as Halen Môn protection against passing off and another way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors. We know that Japanese consumers recognise the premium quality of British brands and are keen to buy the authentic product, so it’s great to hear that Japan is recognising further GIs from the UK.

Further British GIs have been recognised across the world in recent months, with fourteen UK GIs including Welsh Laverbread, Vale of Evesham Asparagus and London Cure Smoked Salmon granted protection in Iceland on 4 December under the Free Trade Agreement between the UK and Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, and the Kingdom of Norway. 

This followed new protections for Scotch Whisky in Brazil, South America’s largest economy, in August, tackling counterfeits and giving distillers the confidence to up their exports to Brazil.

Geographical Indications 
A Geographical indication (GI) is an intellectual property right used on products that have qualities or characteristics attributable to a specific geographical origin. Examples include Scotch Whisky, Welsh Lamb and Melton Mowbray Pork Pies. 
Food, drink and agricultural products with a geographical connection or that are made using traditional methods can be registered and protected as intellectual property. 
Geographical indications protect the authenticity of many of our most prestigious food and drink products and give consumers confidence that international GI products are genuine articles. 
The UK’s annual GI exports are estimated to be worth over £6 billion and account for 25% of UK food and drink exports’ value.

Press release,"10,000 UK Armed Forces personnel deployed overseas to keep us safe this Christmas",The Defence Secretary visited British Army soldiers deployed in Estonia this Christmas to thank them for their service,2024-12-22,Ministry of Defence,"The Defence Secretary visited UK Armed Forces personnel deployed to Estonia to thank them for their vital service at Christmas.

Some 10,000 sailors, marines, soldiers, and aviators will spend Christmas Day deployed overseas, sacrificing celebrations with their families and friends to keep the UK safe.

The work of the UK Armed Forces continues over Christmas on 60 operations in 44 countries this, while hundreds more personnel are working to protect the UK’s skies, shores, and seas at home.

There are 900 British personnel deployed in Estonia, ready to defend NATO’s eastern flank and working alongside French and Estonian forces to deter aggression and uphold stability in eastern Europe.

The visit to Estonia by the Defence Secretary also highlighted the UK’s unwavering dedication to NATO and commitment to defending the alliance.

Defence Secretary, John Healey MP, said: 

In a world in which global insecurities are rising, we depend more and more on those who are willing to serve. And those who are willing to serve are supported by the families that stand with them and behind them.

This Christmas, I pay special tribute to those 10,000 military personnel who are deployed overseas, many of them not seeing family and loved ones at this important time.

It was an honour to spend time with some of those troops in Estonia, to serve them Christmas lunch and thank them for their commitment and professionalism. This week they will sacrifice what most of us take for granted, that special time with our families, to ensure that our nation is safe. 

Our British deployment in Estonia demonstrates our unshakeable commitment to NATO and the security of Europe, keeping us secure at home and strong abroad. Our presence here is a powerful message to our allies and adversaries: the UK stands ready to defend its allies and uphold our shared values, all year round.

The visit to Estonia provided an opportunity for the Defence Secretary to discuss Project ASGARD, which will help UK Armed Forces in the country utilise new and emerging tech to become more lethal and better able to defeat the enemy.

It will harness developing technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), drones, and advanced sensors to help more quickly discover and process information and strike enemies on the battlefield, with priority work continuing on the programme in 2025.

The UK’s relationship with Estonia is a cornerstone of NATO’s defence. British personnel stationed in Estonia form a vital part of the enhanced Forward Presence, ensuring a permanent presence along the alliance’s eastern flank.

The visit comes as the UK has recently signed a defence roadmap with Estonia. The agreement will see the UK’s 4th Brigade Combat Team held at high readiness from 2025, ready to deploy at short notice to Estonia in times of crisis.

It will also include the first overseas deployment of the UK’s cutting-edge Challenger 3 tanks and Boxer armoured vehicles, reinforcing NATO’s defensive capabilities along its eastern border.

The British deployment at Tapa remains the UK’s largest permanent overseas deployment, and both countries are working together closer than ever, with the UK leading on the new DIAMOND initiative, which will improve NATO’s integrated air and missile defence by ensuring that the different air defence systems across the Alliance operate better and more jointly across Europe.

Paying tribute to Armed Forces personnel on duty at Christmas, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said:

Thank you to all our Armed Forces personnel for your extraordinary hard work this year.

From delivering the nuclear deterrent and policing NATO skies, to training Ukrainian recruits and protecting merchant shipping in the Red Sea, the Armed Forces have stepped up to deliver all that the nation asks of us.

I am immensely grateful to those deployed away from home over the festive season and wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

In the UK, Royal Air Force aviators at RAF Boulmer and NATS Swanwick are ready to scramble Typhoon aircraft from RAF Coningsby and RAF Lossiemouth to monitor any hostile aircraft which approach UK airspace.

Behind the scenes and out of sight at the MOD’s digital HQ in Corsham, military cyber experts will remain vigilant this festive season, defending the UK against constant cyber threats every minute of every day.

These dedicated professionals ensure the security of vital digital networks, guaranteeing that the systems that connect our people, places, and equipment run smoothly and securely.

Royal Navy ships will also continue their work protecting the UK’s seas and coastline.

Somewhere, deep in the ocean, a Royal Navy nuclear attack submarine continues to provide the nation’s nuclear deterrent in a patrol that has continued 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 55 years.

And the Household Division of the British Army will continue to guard royal palaces in the nation’s capital throughout the Christmas period.

In an address to the soldiers deployed at Tapa Army Base in Estonia, the Defence Secretary said:

I wanted to say, above all, thank you. Thank you on behalf of all those back home who will never have the chance to say this to you for themselves. Thank you for your commitment to keeping our country safe.

This is a really important deployment for us. What you’re doing here really matters. It matters for the security of Europe, and it matters to us all back home in Britain.

You are making good on Britain’s unshakable commitment to NATO and to a safe and peaceful Europe. And that’s why we have this Operation CABRIT, the biggest commitment of British troops in another country.

Here on the front line, we must also be on the cutting edge of new technologies and new combat techniques we must learn from Ukraine.

We ask a lot of you all in the Armed Forces, not least the separation from your families and your friends and your loved ones. And at Christmas, that sense of separation can be especially strong.

So thank you for your service. Thank you for your willingness to sacrifice what almost all of the rest of us take for granted. It’s an honour to be with you.",Armed forces
