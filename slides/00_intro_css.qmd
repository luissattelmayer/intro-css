## Introduction to CSS {.smaller}

- Introduce to the field of CSS
- Mostly about text analysis
- Only the basics to explore more
- Require you know about programming
- Goal to provide less technical introduction possible, focus on use cases

## What are CSS {.smaller}

- Use of computing powers to analyze social phenomena
- Quite recent and interdisciplinary
- Not a "field" but rather a set of tools and methods
- But specific journals have developed, networks (SICSS) and now positions

## Evolution over last decades {.smaller}

- More data
    - Data on the web
    - Date from the web
- Computing power 
    - More powerful computers and hardware
    - More powerful algorithms, models, IA
    
## New opportunities

- New data sources
- Unstructured data : not produced by researcher
- Collecting population rather than sample



## Developments in political science

- Early development of computational text analysis in the 2000's in political science : convert text to numbers to perform statistical analysis
- But really booming over the last few years with advances in AI allowing to perform more complex analysis
- Even more recent developemnts : 
    - Muiltilingual text analysis
    - Image, Video as data, multimodal analysis
    - Generative language

- Using gilardi and Wuest 2018 different steps ? 

- Transformation of text corpora into numbers to perform statistical analysis

-   For this we need to use text-as-data, meaning, we have to transform our documents with a **numerical representation** : this is what text as data means : featurisation : want to represent a collection of documents to a numerical form

-   To learn from the data the function linking the text and the label, the machine needs to have numbers and not text so we need to transform our text in \*\*a numerical representation

-   Learn feature representation of text : based on Natural Language Processing techniques, whole scientific field design to use computers to understand text

# Corpus selection

## What is a corpus ? {.smaller}

- Every project involving text analysis starts with a corpus
- Choose documents to analyze
- A corpus is a collection of texts
- Crucial task and often overlooked
- Corresponds to identifying the population of interest

## Corpus selection {.smaller}

- Start a research interest about a social phenomena
- What would be a corpus that would help me answer this question ?
- Eg. twitter data is fun but not useful for everything
- Corpus and metadata

##

- How exhaustive is the corpus ? Is it only a sample or not
- Think about data generation process : how these texts were produced
- Important to explore, read some of the texts
- Think about quantity of interest : what could you derive as a measure from those texts : eg. How much a given topic is discussed in these texts


## Finding or creating a corpus {.smaller}

-  Existing corpora vs creating original corpora
- Existing corpora : 
    - Texs datasets already available in such format : eg. Manifesto corpus, UNGA corpus, corpus that other researchers have collected, Open data 
- Collecting texts
    - API
    - Web scraping
    
## API {.smaller}


- Apycalipse : Facebook, Instagram and Twitter Researcher access have closed (see [minet](https://github.com/medialab/minet) for workaround)
- [Bluesky](https://github.com/JBGruber/atrrr)
