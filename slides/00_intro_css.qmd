# Course Introduction {.smaller}
## Instructors {.smaller}

- Malo Jan
- Luis Sattelmayer

## Goal of the course {.smaller}

- Introduction to Computational Social Sciences
- From data collection to analysis
- Mostly about text analysis
- Only the basics to explore more
- Require you know about programming
- Goal to provide less technical introduction possible, focus on use cases

## Outline of the course {.smaller}

- Day 1 : Introduction to CSS + Web scraping
- Day 2 : Manipulating text data
- Day 3 : Supervised learning for text classification
- Day 4 : Unsupervised learning
- Day 5 : Large language models

## Course structure {.smaller}

- Lecture session in the morning
- 1 "lab" lecture in the afternoon
- 1 session for applying what you learned
- Ressrouces and addtional scripts for methods not covered in the course

## What are CSS {.smaller}


> Computational social science is an interdisciplinary field that advances theories of human behavior by applying computational techniques to large datasets from social media sites, the Internet, or other digitized archives such as administrative records. @edelmann2020computational


- Institutionalization of CSS
    - Specific journals : eg. JCSS
    - Networks : eg. SICCS
    - Positions : Assistant professor in CSS, postdocs...

## Evolution over last decades {.smaller}

CSS from two main developments : 

- New and more data
    - Data on the web : digitization of text, historical archives, administrative records, open data
    - Data from the web : social media, websites
- New methods and computing power 
    - More powerful computers and hardware
    - More powerful algorithms, models, IA
    
## More data {.smaller}

- New data sources
- Unstructured data : not produced by researchers (such as survey, qualitative interviews)
- Collecting population rather than sample
- Allows to train more complex models

## More computing power and methods  {.smaller}


- Development of new algorithms, models in Natural Language Processing
- Rise of LLms
- GPU

## Developments in political science

- Early development of computational text analysis in the 2000's in political science : convert text to numbers to perform statistical analysis
- But really booming over the last few years with advances in AI allowing to perform more complex analysis
- Even more recent developemnts : 
    - Muiltilingual text analysis
    - Image, Video as data, multimodal analysis
    - Generative language

## CSS pipeline {.smaller}

- Corpus acquisition, selection and cleaning
- Text preprocessing : convert text to numbers
- Use text-as-data as input for statistical models
